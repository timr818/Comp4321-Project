About
CSE
Computer
science
is
the
discipline
that
studies
the
structure,
function,
and
applications
of
computers
as
well
as
the
interconnection
of
computers.
Covering
topics
in
the
areas
of
foundations
of
computer
science
and
computer
engineering,
artificial
intelligence,
networking,
computer
graphics,
multimedia
computing,
software
and
web
technologies,
and
data
and
knowledge-base
systems,
the
Computer
Science
programs
at
this
University
are
dedicated
to
educate
students
and
to
advance
research
in
computer
and
information
technology;
as
well
as
to
assist
in
the
development
and
growth
of
the
information
industry
in
the
region.
Through
the
efforts
of
researchers
and
engineers,
computers
have
evolved
from
large,
slow,
expensive,
and
very
specialized
systems
to
small,
fast,
affordable,
and
ordinary
tools
that
are
part
of
virtually
everyone's
life.
Advances
in
networking
technologies
and
human-computer
interfacing
technologies
have
further
created
a
digital
culture.
The
ubiquitous
nature
of
computers
in
today's
workplace
and
home
environment
is
making
computer
literacy
a
requirement
not
only
for
all
professionals
in
industrial
societies
but
also
for
everybody
living
in
the
digital
culture.
Computer
Science
is
still
a
young
field.
Although
we
have
witnessed
numerous
advances
in
the
past,
this
is
only
the
beginning
of
a
new
revolution
as
the
potential
of
information
technology
has
not
yet
been
fully
realized.
Information
technology
is
in
the
midst
of
a
revolution
as
we
move
from
explicit
interactions
with
disconnected
computing
devices
to
implicit
and
pervasive
interactions
with
highly
interconnected,
integrated
digital
resources
embedded
in
the
environments
in
which
we
work,
live,
learn,
and
play.
The
impact
of
computer
science
and
information
engineering
will
be
broad
and
deep.
Computer
Science
programs
at
HKUST
prepare
students
for
exciting
challenges
and
new
opportunities
that
help
to
bring
such
impact
to
our
lives.
The
Department
offers
a
full
range
of
courses
to
meet
the
needs
of
its
own
students
and
those
from
other
departments.
Its
programs
lead
to
the
BEng,
BSc,
MSc,
MPhil,
and
PhD
degrees.
Aside
from
taking
computer
science
courses,
students
are
encouraged
to
design
individual
study
plans
tailored
to
their
own
interests.

Postgraduate

Early
Recruiting
The
Department
of
Computer
Science
and
Engineering
(CSE)
of
the
Hong
Kong
University
of
Science
and
Technology
(HKUST)
is
recruiting
MPhil
and
PhD
students
to
start
in
Fall
2018.
We
are
looking
for
outstanding
undergraduate
students
as
well
as
graduate
students
with
a
Masters
degree
in
Computer
Science
and
related
areas.
According
to
the
latest
QS
World
University
Rankings,
HKUST
is
ranked
the
30th
globally,
and
our
CSE
department
ranked
the
14th
worldwide
in
the
Subject
of
Computer
Science
and
Information
Systems.
Our
department
has
produced
pioneering
work
in
several
areas,
including
but
not
limited
to,
artificial
intelligence,
cybersecurity,
data
and
knowledge
management,
human
computer
interaction,
networks
and
distributed
systems,
software
technologies,
theoretical
computer
science
and
algorithms,
and
vision
and
graphics.
Our
department
consists
of
over
50
faculty
members,
about
60
MPhil
students
and
210
PhD
students.
The
MPhil
study
takes
one
to
two
years,
and
the
PhD
study
four
to
five
years.
Many
of
our
postgraduate
alumni
work
at
major
IT
companies
such
as
Baidu,
Facebook,
Google,
Huawei,
IBM,
Microsoft,
and
Tencent,
and
a
significant
number
of
our
PhD
graduates
pursue
their
careers
at
research
institutes
and
universities
all
over
the
world.
If
interested,
please
check
out
the
departmental
web
page
on
where
do
our
PhD
graduates
go.
Postgraduate
students
have
sufficient
scholarship
support
during
their
study
at
HKUST.
The
amount
of
scholarship
is
about
HKD196,000
(USD25,000)
per
person
per
year.
The
School
of
Engineering
selects
excellent
postgraduate
students
to
award
additional
scholarship
to
cover
the
tuition.
The
annual
tuition
of
a
postgraduate
student
is
about
HKD40,000
(USD5,000).
Starting
in
2010,
the
Hong
Kong
government
selects
incoming
PhD
students
to
award
the
prestigious
Hong
Kong
PhD
Fellowship
(HKPF)
each
year.
The
amount
of
the
HKPF
is
around
HKD20,000
(USD2,500)
per
month.
Additionally,
each
awardee
has
a
travel
allowance
of
HKD10,000
(USD1,250)
each
year
for
the
first
three
years.
In
the
past
two
years,
our
department
was
awarded
both
8
HKPFs
respectively.
Our
postgraduate
admissions
require
applicants
to
have
good
academic
records
in
their
areas
of
study
and
to
have
obtained
a
Bachelor's
degree
by
the
time
of
their
HKUST
enrollment.
Applicants
also
need
to
satisfy
the
University
English
Language
Requirements.
We
recruit
postgraduate
students
in
two
phases.
The
first
phase
is
early
recruiting,
targeted
at
excellent
MPhil
and
PhD
applicants
through
telephone
or
onsite
interviews.
To
apply,
you
can
fill
out
the
preliminary
application
form
at
the
departmental
early
recruiting
website
(Registration
for
early
admission
has
closed).
We
will
process
these
online
applications
and
shortlist
candidates
to
invite
for
on-site
interviews.
This
year,
the
early
admission
interviews
will
start
in
September
2017,
details
to
follow.
Applicants
will
be
notified
their
interview
results
one
to
two
weeks
after
their
interviews.
After
the
early
recruiting
phase,
applicants
can
still
send
regular
application
packages
to
the
HKUST
Postgraduate
Admissions.
Finally,
we
encourage
exceptional
PhD

class,

grade
higher
than
85/100,
excellent
English)

contact
us
to
inquire
about
the
HKPF

web
site.

you
